# learn_ai

Aim for this Project:

learning AI and try to using AI for arduino DIY intelligent car.

Function need to be achieve:
1.Use Raspberry Pi or adurino to achieve the basic function like driving/ braking/ streeing for the car. 

2.Create a driving simulation platform which can simulate the basic operations of car driving, such as stepping on the pedal to control the car's movement, deceleration or braking. Want to crate this with g29.

3.Get pictures of the vehicle in motion and use AI to identify the condition of the vehicle in motion
